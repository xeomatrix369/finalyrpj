\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

The goal of this Project was to develop and simulate Transistor Level Circuit of a PLL which can be used in implementing in RFICs.The PLL has been designed using 180nm CMOS technology and the circuit has been simulated using LTspice.All these circuits where designed and optimized to get a good settling time.There is huge scope of Imporvement in the same with this project we have showcased the proof of concept of the PLL and its working.
