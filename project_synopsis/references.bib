  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of two types of linear block codes: Hamming and cyclic codes. We have generated, encoded and decoded these codes as well as schemes and/or algorithms of error-detecting and error-correcting of these codes. We have managed to detect and correct errors in a communication channel using error detection and correction schemes of hamming and cyclic codes.},
